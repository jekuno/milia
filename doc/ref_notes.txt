DEFAULT_SCOPE RAILS 3.1 (from https://gist.github.com/958338)
================================================================================
default_scope can take a block, lambda, or any other object which responds 
to call for lazy evaluation:

  default_scope { ... }
  default_scope lambda { ... }
  default_scope method(:foo)

This feature was originally implemented by Tim Morgan, but was then removed in 
favour of defining a default_scope class method, 
but has now been added back in by Jon Leighton. 
The relevant lighthouse ticket is #1812.

Default scopes are now evaluated at the latest possible moment, 
to avoid problems where scopes would be created which would implicitly contain 
the default scope, which would then be impossible to get rid of via 
  Model.unscoped.
No
te that this means that if you are inspecting the internal structure of an 
ActiveRecord::Relation, it will not contain the default scope, though the 
resulting query will do. You can get a relation containing the default scope by 
calling ActiveRecord#with_default_scope, though this is not part of the public API.

Calling default_scope multiple times in a class 
(including when a superclass calls default_scope) is deprecated. 
The current behavior is that this will merge the default scopes together:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base # Rails 3.1
    default_scope where(:published => true)
    default_scope where(:hidden => false)
    # The default scope is now: where(:published => true, :hidden => false)
  end

In Rails 3.2, the behavior will be changed to overwrite previous scopes:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base # Rails 3.2
    default_scope where(:published => true)
    default_scope where(:hidden => false)
    # The default scope is now: where(:hidden => false)
  end
If you wish to merge default scopes in special ways, it is recommended to define 
your default scope as a class method and use the standard techniques for  
sharing code (inheritance, mixins, etc.):

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    def self.default_scope
      where(:published => true).where(:hidden => false)
    end
  end

=================================================================== 
class Tenant < ActiveRecord::Base
  class << self
    def current
      Thread.current[:current_tenant]
    end

    def current=(tenant)
      Thread.current[:current_tenant] = tenant
    end
  end
end

app/models/tenant_scoped_model.rb
class TenantScopedModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true

  class << self
    protected
      def current_scoped_methods
        last = scoped_methods.last
        last.respond_to?(:call) ? relation.scoping { last.call } : last
      end      
  end

  belongs_to :tenant

  default_scope lambda { where('tenant_id = ?', Tenant.current) }

  before_save { self.tenant = Tenant.current }
end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_filter do
    @tenant = Tenant.current = Tenant.find_by_host!(request.host)
  end
end

Caveats

Calling unscoped bypasses the default_scope; this is both good and bad because you can get all partitioned data from a model regardless of the current tenant.
You will get errors in the console when working with a scoped model unless you set Tenant.current.
before_save { self.tenant = Tenant.current } is necessary because rails does not automatically set the attributes from our default_scope because it is a lambda.

===============================================================================
 but setting a global on the current thread felt like a big hack. (Here's a good article on Thread.current ) Lucky for me Jose was willing to spend a little time working with me and the resulting code works without globals. Instead of passing a global around we removed the Singleton code from the resolver and create an instance of the resolver per each account:

 
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_filter :set_resolver
 
  def current_account
    @current_account ||= Account.find_by_domain(request.host) || Account.find_by_code(request.subdomains.first) || Account.first
  end
 
  @@account_resolver = {}
 
  def account_resolver_for(account)
    @@account_resolver[account.id] ||= CustomView::Resolver.new(account)
  end
 
  def set_resolver
    return unless current_account
    resolver = account_resolver_for(current_account)
    resolver.update_account(current_account)
    prepend_view_path resolver
  end
 
end
 class Resolver < ActionView::Resolver
 
    def initialize(account)
      @account = account
    end
 
    # Check if the custom_view_cache_count is still the same, if not clear the cache
    def update_account(updated_account)
      self.clear_cache unless @account.custom_view_cache_count == updated_account.custom_view_cache_count
      @account = updated_account
    end
  end
  
POSTGRES RULES
===============================================================================
36.2. Views and the Rule System
Views in PostgreSQL are implemented using the rule system. 
In fact, there is essentially no difference between:

  CREATE VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytab;

compared against the two commands:

  CREATE TABLE myview (same column list as mytab);
  CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS ON SELECT TO myview DO INSTEAD
      SELECT * FROM mytab;

because this is exactly what the CREATE VIEW command does internally. 
This has some side effects. One of them is that the information about a view 
in the PostgreSQL system catalogs is exactly the same as it is for a table. 
So for the parser, there is absolutely no difference between a table and a view. 
They are the same thing: relations.
